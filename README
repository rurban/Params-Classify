NAME

Params::Classify - argument type classification

DESCRIPTION

This module provides various type-testing functions.  These are intended
for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they
are operating on.  For example, some functions wish to behave differently
depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded functions
in C++).

These functions only provide type classification; they do not enforce
type restrictions.  Type enforcement may, of course, be built using
these classification functions, but the reader's attention is drawn
to Params::Validate.

INSTALLATION
