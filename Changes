version 0.008; 2009-09-10

  * add "check_" functions for argument checking

  * strict argument checking in all functions that take control arguments

  * revise documentation

  * revise pure Perl code to avoid unnecessary argument copying

  * in XS code, make all auxiliary functions "static"

  * revise POD markup

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

version 0.007; 2009-05-13

  * XS implementation, used if available with fallback to existing pure
    Perl implementation if XS is not available

  * use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  * in documentation, use the term "truth value" instead of the less
    precise "boolean"

  * use full stricture in Build.PL

version 0.006; 2009-02-15

  * withdraw is_pure_string() and is_pure_number() functions, because
    they've never worked right and bring in a big dependency for marginal
    utility

  * use "base" pragma to import Exporter behaviour

  * test POD syntax and coverage

  * build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  * complete dependency list

  * include signature in distribution

  * in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

version 0.005; 2007-09-02

  * in t/purity.t, modify purity test on dualvar(0, "0") to operate
    appropriately on older Perls where this has a different numeric
    value from 0

  * in t/purity.t, fix a skip count for the case where dualvar() is
    not available

version 0.004; 2007-08-16

  * in t/purity.t, fix a skip count for the case where floating point
    zero is unsigned

version 0.003; 2007-08-15

  * in t/purity.t, modify purity test on dualvar(+0.0, "0") to operate
    appropriately on older Perls where "0" numifies to a floating
    point zero, and add a test for dualvar(0, "0")

version 0.002; 2007-01-25

  * add is_pure_string() and is_pure_number() functions that determine
    how complicated a string scalar is

  * in documentation for is_number(), reference Scalar::Number and
    Data::Integer

  * correct version requirement of Scalar::Util in module, making it
    consistent with the dependency listed in Makefile.PL

version 0.001; 2006-08-03

  * bugfix: in is_number(), check whether numeric conversion warns, rather
    than using looks_like_number(), to avoid being confused by dualvars

  * in t/ref.t, skip *foo{FORMAT} tests on older Perls that don't provide
    that facility

  * refer to Data::Float for classification of floating point values

  * versioned dependencies in .pm

  * declare module dependencies in Makefile.PL

  * correct .cvsignore (had copy&modify detritus)

  * include Changes file

version 0.000; 2004-03-20

  * initial released version
