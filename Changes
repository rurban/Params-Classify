version 0.004; 2007-08-16

  * in t/purity.t, fix a skip count for the case where floating point
    zero is unsigned

version 0.003; 2007-08-15

  * in t/purity.t, modify purity test on dualvar(+0.0, "0") to operate
    appropriately on older Perls where "0" numifies to a floating
    point zero, and add a test for dualvar(0, "0")

version 0.002; 2007-01-25

  * add is_pure_string() and is_pure_number() functions that determine
    how complicated a string scalar is

  * in documentation for is_number(), reference Scalar::Number and
    Data::Integer

  * correct version requirement of Scalar::Util in module, making it
    consistent with the dependency listed in Makefile.PL

version 0.001; 2006-08-03

  * bugfix: in is_number(), check whether numeric conversion warns, rather
    than using looks_like_number(), to avoid being confused by dualvars

  * in t/ref.t, skip *foo{FORMAT} tests on older Perls that don't provide
    that facility

  * refer to Data::Float for classification of floating point values

  * versioned dependencies in .pm

  * declare module dependencies in Makefile.PL

  * correct .cvsignore (had copy&modify detritus)

  * include Changes file

version 0.000; 2004-03-20

  * initial released version
